This was just used to test out the ability to deveop a desktop app in Avalonia on Linux using Avalonia 11, .Net8, & VSCode

It is VERY basic foundation of the Avalonia/SimpleJournal App but with more focus on the Avalonia side without mixing in 
any WPF by accident or something.  This will not be in further development.
